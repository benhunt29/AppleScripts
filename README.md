AppleScripts
===

A small repo to keep track of Applescripts that I've worked on.

Running the Scripts
===

### Running in the terminal
```bash
git clone git@github.com:therynamo/AppleScripts.git

# Note: you can use any file in this repo, not just `orientation`
osascript -l JavaScript orientation.jxa
```

### Running in VS Code

I recommend downloading [AppleScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idleberg.applescript), an extension for VS Code that has good syntax highlighting and allows you to run in the IDE.

Open up this repository using VS Code, open a file, hit `Option + Shift + R` to build and run the Applescript.
